=== Mitigation

To mitigate the log4j vulnerability it is advised to update Java versions and log4j packages. In more recent versions JNDI calls are no longer enabled by default. Also in newer versions of Java the vulnerability is mitigated.

=== The Larger Lesson

The log4j vulnerability is a lesson in two main ways.

1. Packages should have specific well defined uses
2. Users should always be wary of installed packages

The log4j vulnerability is an example of why it can be dangerous to trust outside packages. log4j was a very easy package to install and while it was useful it was also hiding a large security flaw. It is worth finding packages that only do small jobs, this helps ensure packages are less likely to have security holes. It is also important to use automated tools and manual review of packages you download to make sure your application stays protected.
